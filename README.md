# zip-builder

Automatically build flashable zips for Android based on simple configuration files. Supports Android Lollipop 5.0 through Nougat 7.1.

Full documentation can be found [here](https://shadow53.com/android/zip-builder/).

Example configuration files can be found in the `examples/` directory. Those files are used to generate the zips provided by me for use [here](https://shadow53.com/android/downloads/)
